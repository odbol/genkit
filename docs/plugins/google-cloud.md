# Google Cloud plugin

The Google Cloud plugin exports Firebase Genkit telemetry and logging data to
the 
[Cloud Observability](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations)
suite, which powers the 
[Firebase AI Monitoring](https://forms.gle/Lp5S1NxbZUXsWc457) dashboard.

## Installation

```posix-terminal
npm i --save @genkit-ai/google-cloud
```

When running Genkit code locally that includes this plugin, you will also need 
the [Google Cloud CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
installed.

## Set up a Google Cloud account

This plugin requires a Google Cloud account/project. All Firebase projects
include one by default ([GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)), 
or you can sign up at https://cloud.google.com.

Prior to adding the plugin, make sure that the following APIs are enabled for 
your GCP project:

- [Cloud Logging API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/logging.googleapis.com)
- [Cloud Trace API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudtrace.googleapis.com)
- [Cloud Monitoring API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/monitoring.googleapis.com)

These APIs should be listed in the
[API dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard) for your 
project.

Click [here](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841) to learn more 
about enabling and disabling APIs.

## Genkit configuration

To enable Cloud Tracing, Logging, and Monitoring (metrics), simply call 
`enableGoogleCloudTelemetry()`:

```ts
import { enableGoogleCloudTelemetry } from '@genkit-ai/google-cloud';

enableGoogleCloudTelemetry();
```

When running in production, telemetry will automatically be exported.

### Authentication and authorization

The plugin requires a Google Cloud project ID and application credentials. 

#### Google Cloud

If deploying your code to a Google Cloud environment (Cloud
Functions, Cloud Run, etc), the project ID and credentials will be discovered
automatically via
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc).

You will need to apply the following roles to the service account that is 
running your code (i.e. 'attached service account') via the 
[IAM Console](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/iam-admin/iam):

- `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
- `roles/cloudtrace.agent`
- `roles/logging.logWriter`

#### Local Development

When doing local development, in order for your user credentials to be available
to the plugin, additional steps are required.

1. Set the `GCLOUD_PROJECT` environment variable to your Google Cloud project.

2. Authenticate using the `gcloud` CLI:

    ```posix-terminal
    gcloud auth application-default login
    ```

#### Production environments outside of Google Cloud

If possible, it is still recommended to leverage the 
[Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) 
process to make credentials available to the plugin.

Typically this involves generating a service account key/pair and deploying
those credentials to your production environment. 

1. Follow the instructions to set up a 
[service account key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating).

2. Ensure the service account has the following roles:
    - `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
    - `roles/cloudtrace.agent`
    - `roles/logging.logWriter`

3. Deploy the credential file to production (**do not** check into source code)

4. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable as the path to
the credential file.

    ```
    GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "path/to/your/key/file"
    ```

In some serverless environments, you may not be able to deploy a credential
file. In this case, as an alternative to steps 3 & 4 above, you can set the 
`GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS` environment variable with the contents of the
credential file as follows:

```
GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDS='{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "your-private-key",
  "client_email": "your-client-email",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "your-cert-url"
}'
```

## Plugin configuration

The `enableGoogleCloudTelemetry()` function takes an optional configuration
object which configures the
[OpenTelemetry NodeSDK](https://open-telemetry.github.io/opentelemetry-js/classes/_opentelemetry_sdk_node.NodeSDK.html)
instance.

```ts
import { AlwaysOnSampler } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-base';

enableGoogleCloudTelemetry({
  forceDevExport: false, // Set this to true to export telemetry for local runs
  sampler: new AlwaysOnSampler(),
  autoInstrumentation: true,
  autoInstrumentationConfig: {
    '@opentelemetry/instrumentation-fs': { enabled: false },
    '@opentelemetry/instrumentation-dns': { enabled: false },
    '@opentelemetry/instrumentation-net': { enabled: false },
  },
  metricExportIntervalMillis: 5_000,
});
```
The configuration objects allows fine grained control over various aspects of
the telemetry export outlined below.

#### credentials
Allows specifying credentials directly using
[JWTInput](http://cloud/nodejs/docs/reference/google-auth-library/latest/google-auth-library/jwtinput)
from the google-auth library.

#### sampler

For cases where exporting all traces isn't practical, OpenTelemetry allows trace
[sampling](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/instrumentation/#sampler).

There are four preconfigured samplers:

- [AlwaysOnSampler](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk/trace/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/samplers/AlwaysOnSampler.java) - samples all traces
- [AlwaysOffSampler](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk/trace/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/samplers/AlwaysOffSampler.java) - samples no traces
- [ParentBased](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk/trace/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/samplers/ParentBasedSampler.java) - samples based on parent span
- [TraceIdRatioBased](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/main/sdk/trace/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/sdk/trace/samplers/TraceIdRatioBasedSampler.java) - samples a configurable percentage of traces

#### autoInstrumentation & autoInstrumentationConfig

Enabling
[automatic instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/automatic/)
allows OpenTelemetry to capture telemetry data from
[third-party libraries](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js-contrib/blob/main/metapackages/auto-instrumentations-node/src/utils.ts)
without the need to modify code.

#### metricExportIntervalMillis

This field specifies the metrics export interval in milliseconds.

> Note: The minimum export interval for Google Cloud Monitoring is 5000ms.

#### metricExportTimeoutMillis

This field specifies the timeout for the metrics export in milliseconds.

#### disableMetrics

Provides an override that disables metrics export while still exporting traces
and logs.

#### disableTraces

Provides an override that disables exporting traces while still exprting metrics
and logs.

#### disableLoggingIO

Provides an override that disables collecting input and output logs.

#### forceDevExport

This option will force Genkit to export telemetry and log data when running in
the `dev` environment (e.g. locally).

> Note: When running locally, internal telemetry buffers may not fully flush
prior to the process exiting, resulting in an incomplete telemetry export.

## Test your integration

When configuring the plugin, use `forceDevExport: true` to enable telemetry
export for local runs. Navigate to the Google Cloud Logs, Metrics, or Trace
Explorer to view telemetry. Alternatively, navigate to the
[Firebase AI Monitoring](https://forms.gle/Lp5S1NxbZUXsWc457) dashboard for a 
gen AI idiomatic view of telemetry.

# Google Cloud Observability suite

Once your code (e.g. flow) is deployed, navigate to the
[Cloud Monitoring](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/) dashboard and 
select your project. From here, you can easily navigate between the Logs,
Metrics and Trace explorers for production monitoring.

<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-suite.png" width="750">

## Logs and traces

From the left hand side menu, click 'Logs explorer' under the 'Explore' heading.

<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-logs-explorer-menu.png" width="750">

Here, you will see all logs that are associated with your deployed Genkit code, 
including `console.log()`. Any log which has the prefix `[genkit]` is a 
Genkit-internal log that contains information that may be interesting for
debugging purposes. For example, Genkit logs in the format `Config[...]` contain
metadata such as the temperature and topK values for specific LLM inferences. 
Logs in the format `Output[...]` contain LLM responses while `Input[...]` logs
contain the prompts. Cloud Logging has robust ACLs that allow fine grained
control over access to sensitive logs.

> Note: Prompts and LLM responses are redacted from trace attributes in Cloud
Trace. For specific log lines, it is possible to navigate to their respective
traces by clicking on the extended menu
<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-log-menu-icon.png" height="15"> icon and
selecting "View in trace details".

 <img src="../resources/cloud-ops-view-trace-details.png" width="750">

This will bring up a trace preview pane providing a quick glance of the details
of the trace. To get to the full details, click the "View in Trace" link at the
top right of the pane.

 <img src="../resources/cloud-ops-view-in-trace.png" width="750">

The most prominent navigation element in Cloud Trace is the trace scatter plot.
It contains all collected traces in a given time span.

 <img src="../resources/cloud-ops-trace-graph.png" width="750">

Clicking on each data point will show its details below the scatter plot.

 <img src="../resources/cloud-ops-trace-view.png" width="750">

The detailed view contains the flow shape, including all steps, and important
timing information. Cloud Trace has the ability to interleave all logs
associated with a given trace within this view. Select the "Show expanded"
option in the "Logs & events" drop down.

 <img src="../resources/cloud-ops-show-expanded.png" width="750">

The resultant view allows detailed examination of logs in the context of the
trace, including prompts and LLM responses.

 <img src="../resources/cloud-ops-output-logs.png" width="750">

## Metrics

Viewing all metrics exported by Genkit can be done by clicking on 
'Metrics management' under the 'Configure' heading in the left hand side menu.

<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-metrics-mgmt.png" width="750">

The metrics management console contains a tabular view of all collected metrics,
including those that pertain to Cloud Run and its surrounding environment.
Clicking on the 'Workload' option will reveal a list that includes 
Genkit-collected metrics. Any metric with the `genkit` prefix constitutes an
internal Genkit metric.

<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-metrics-table.png" width="750">

Genkit collects several categories of metrics including: feature, action, and 
generate. Each metric has several useful dimensions facilitating robust
filtering and grouping.

Common dimensions include:

- `flow_name` - the top-level name of the flow.
- `flow_path` - the span and its parent span chain up to the root span.
- `error_code` - in case of an error, the corresponding error code.
- `error_message` - in case of an error, the corresponding error message.
- `model` - the name of the model.
- `temperature` - the inference temperature [value](https://ai.google.dev/docs/concepts#model-parameters).
- `topK` - the inference topK [value](https://ai.google.dev/docs/concepts#model-parameters).
- `topP` - the inference topP [value](https://ai.google.dev/docs/concepts#model-parameters).

### Feature metrics

Features are the top-level entry-point to your Genkit code. In most cases, this
will be a flow. Otherwise, this will be the top-most span in a trace.

| Name                    | Type      | Description             |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| genkit/feature/requests | Counter   | Number of requests      |
| genkit/feature/latency  | Histogram | Execution latency in ms |

Each feature metric contains the following dimensions:

| Name          | Description                                                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name          | The name of the feature. In most cases, this is the top-level Genkit flow        |
| status        | 'success' or 'failure' depending on whether or not the feature request succeeded |
| error         | Only set when `status=failure`. Contains the error type that caused the failure  |
| source        | The Genkit source language. Eg. 'ts'                                             |
| sourceVersion | The Genkit framework version                                                     |


### Action metrics

Actions represent a generic step of execution within Genkit. Each of these steps
will have the following metrics tracked:

| Name                    | Type      | Description                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| genkit/action/requests  | Counter   | Number of times this action has been executed |
| genkit/action/latency   | Histogram | Execution latency in ms                       |

Each action metric contains the following dimensions:

| Name          | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name          | The name of the action                                                                               |
| featureName   | The name of the parent feature being executed                                                        |
| path          | The path of execution from the feature root to this action. eg. '/myFeature/parentAction/thisAction' |
| status        | 'success' or 'failure' depending on whether or not the action succeeded                              |
| error         | Only set when `status=failure`. Contains the error type that caused the failure                      |
| source        | The Genkit source language. Eg. 'ts'                                                                 |
| sourceVersion | The Genkit framework version                                                                         |

### Generate metrics

These are special action metrics relating to actions that interact with a model.
In addition to requests and latency, input and output are also tracked, with
model specific dimensions that make debugging and configuration tuning easier.

| Name                                 | Type      | Description                                |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| genkit/ai/generate/requests          | Counter   | Number of times this model has been called |
| genkit/ai/generate/latency           | Histogram | Execution latency in ms                    |

| genkit/ai/generate/output/tokens     | Counter   | Output tokens                              |
| genkit/ai/generate/input/characters  | Counter   | Input characters                           |
| genkit/ai/generate/output/characters | Counter   | Output characters                          |
| genkit/ai/generate/input/images      | Counter   | Input images                               |
| genkit/ai/generate/output/images     | Counter   | Output images                              |
| genkit/ai/generate/input/audio       | Counter   | Input audio files                          |
| genkit/ai/generate/output/audio      | Counter   | Output audio files                         |

Each generate metric contains the following dimensions:

| Name            | Description                                                                                          |

| featureName     | The name of the parent feature being executed                                                        |
| path            | The path of execution from the feature root to this action. eg. '/myFeature/parentAction/thisAction' |
| temperature     | The temperature parameter passed to the model                                                        |
| maxOutputTokens | The maxOutputTokens parameter passed to the model                                                    |
| topK            | The topK parameter passed to the model                                                               |
| topP            | The topP parameter passed to the model                                                               |

Visualizing metrics can be done through the Metrics Explorer. Using the left 
hand side menu, click 'Metrics explorer' under the 'Explore' heading.

<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-metrics-explorer.png" width="750">

Select a metrics by clicking on the 'Select a metric' dropdown, selecting
'Generic Node', 'Genkit', and a metric.

<img src="../resources/cloud-ops-metrics-generic-node.png" width="750">

The visualization of the metric will depend on its type (counter, histogram,
etc). The Metrics Explorer provides robust aggregation and querying facilities
to help graph metrics by their various dimensions.
